>Note: **Additional software optional for tutorial**

>Note: **F12 Opens DevTools**

As we all know, [Quixel megascans](https://quixel.com/megascans/) is shutting down, and everyone is trying to find ways to navigate this change.
I have developed a script that allows you to bulk download all 18,000 assets to a drive of your choice, eliminating the need to manually download each asset individually.


You might wonder why you should download all the files instead of adding them to your library. Since it’s uncertain whether your assets will transfer to the new website, it’s safer to download all the files (each 122KB) and keep them.

## **Step one (add assets to your [libary](https://quixel.com/megascans/purchased) or [purchased](https://quixel.com/megascans/purchased) section**)

>Note: **Code was tested on latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/)**

>Note: **Script for step one is not produced by me**

1. Sign into [Quixel](https://quixel.com/)
2. Go to section [home](https://quixel.com/megascans/home) in Quixel megascans
3. Open DevTools and go to the console
4. Copy code from [misiewiczradoslaw](https://gist.github.com/misiewiczradoslaw/62d045736fe06e44f16c436c6d898d26)
5. Paste script into console and let the magic happen

**Any errors check on original [github page](https://gist.github.com/misiewiczradoslaw/62d045736fe06e44f16c436c6d898d26)**

## **Step two (bulk download assets to your drive)**

>Note: **Code was tested on latest version of [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/download?msockid=1bc281a54b8f640a107595154f8f66dd&form=MA13FJ)**

>Note: **Script for this step was made by me**

>Note: **An [auto scroller](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Other-Desktop-Enhancements/Bahamida-Auto-Scroll.shtml#download) is recommended to quickly find new assets**

>Note: **Running the script multiple times will create duplicates because the script can only write to your drives, not read from them to check if the file is already saved.**

1. Sing into [Quixel megascans](https://quixel.com/megascans/)
2. Go to your [libary](https://quixel.com/megascans/purchased) or [purchased](https://quixel.com/megascans/purchased) section
3. Copy and paste the file directory that you want your assets to download too into the script (line two)
4. Download [Auto Scroll](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Desktop-Enhancements/Other-Desktop-Enhancements/Bahamida-Auto-Scroll.shtml#download) or a auto scroller of your choice.
5. Go to settings of your browser and set download location to chosen folder and do not ask
6. Copy code into console and press enter
7. Set desired amount of downloads
8. Start auto scroller to find new assets 
9. Let script complete downloads
